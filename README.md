LzTeX
-----

LzTeX (pronounce: /ˈleɪzitɛk/, lazy-tex) is a markdown-style for LaTeX.

Project Proposal
----------------

LzTeX propose to be a combination of:

- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/)
- [EzMath](http://code.google.com/p/ezmath/)

LzTeX willing to make you write LaTeX in short form. If you need to convert something to LaTeX, you may take a look at [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)

If you are interest and want to participate in this project, you can raise an [enhancement issue](https://github.com/neizod/LzTeX/Issues).

The Zen of LzTeX
----------------

    Laziness is not always the bad thing.
    Thus, minimalism is prefer.
    But not too minimal to easily confuse.
    And Beautiful comes from inside.
