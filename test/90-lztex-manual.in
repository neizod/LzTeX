Welcome to LzTeX Manual. Since LzTeX is lazy, I'll not write it a lot. :P

The Document
------------

- Use \*...\* (with number of star from 1 to 3) to wrap some text, it will appear as emphasis text.
- Use \`...\` for code. If you want \` inside it, just increase the number of opening and closing \`.
